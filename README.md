## For what ?

It is a group graduate project carried out at the final stage of the SDA course. Working on a group project, and thus
the opportunity to work in a team while creating the application allowed us to take a broader look at the problems being
solved, and above all, it allowed us to learn more about working in the gitflow system.

## Technologies

* JAVA 11
* Spring Boot 2.5.2
* Lombok 1.18.20
* Junit5 5.7.2
* AssertJ 2.2.10
